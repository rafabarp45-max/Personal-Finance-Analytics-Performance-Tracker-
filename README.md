# Personal Finance Analytics & Performance Tracker 📊

## Project Overview
This project consists of a personalized Financial Management System developed in **Excel**. It was designed to monitor monthly expenses, track investments, and optimize financial performance within a real-world context (Dublin, Ireland).

The main goal of this tool is to transition from simple expense tracking to **data-driven financial decision-making**, allowing for a clear view of budget variance and investment growth.

> **Note:** The interface and categories are in **Portuguese** (my native language). All currency values and figures are **fictitious**, used strictly for demonstration, testing, and portfolio purposes.

## Key Features
- **Monthly Budgeting & Variance Analysis:** Each month includes a "Planned vs. Actual" comparison to identify budget leaks and optimize spending.
- **Investment Tracking:** Dedicated monitoring for monthly contributions to **IBKR** (Stocks/ETFs) and **Binance** (Crypto), treating savings as a priority fixed cost.
- **Multi-currency & Forex Management:** Track international transfers (EUR to BRL), calculating average exchange rates and tax impact over time.
- **Yearly Performance Dashboard:** A consolidated view of "Fechamentos" (Monthly Closures) that tracks the evolution of the Emergency Fund and total net worth.

## Technical Skills Applied
- **Data Structuring:** Organized multi-sheet architecture for historical data retention.
- **Advanced Formulas:** Use of conditional logic, lookup functions, and financial math for currency conversion.
- **Data Integrity:** Implementation of validation rules to ensure consistent data entry across different months.
- **Analytical Mindset:** Focused on **Financial Performance Indicators** rather than just bookkeeping.

## Why this project?
As a **Data Analytics student at CCT College Dublin**, I believe that personal projects are the best way to practice data consistency and reporting. This spreadsheet serves as the foundation for a future project where I intend to use **Python (Pandas)** to automate data extraction and **Power BI** for advanced visualization.
